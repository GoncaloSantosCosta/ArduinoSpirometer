# ArduinoSpirometer
This is a group project as part of the Instrumentation and Control Techniques course from the Masters in Biomedichal Engineering at the University of Coimbra. It marked our first time using Arduino.

The project consisted of making a spirometer using Arduino Uno, a 3D printed mouthpiece and the MPXV70007DP sensor to detect pressure differences.
